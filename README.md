# TOOLBOX

This project is a Git repository that contains several generic libraries to simplify building applications. These libraries can be used to speed up development and improve the quality of the code.

---

## 1.- Getting Started

This libraries can be downloades with the next command.

```properties
$ git clone git@github.com:JosebaRG/toolbox.git
```

## 2.- Libraries

### 2.1.- Libstring

This library written in C was created to simplify working with strings in C. The implemented functions aim to provide similar functionality to that obtained in LabVIEW.

Library can be included in C with:

```c
#include "libstring.h"
```

### 2.2.- Libjxml

This library written in C defindes a structure tree to store an XML file in memory. This library provides functions to convert the XML file into the tree structure and vice versa.

Library can be included in C with:

```c
#include "libjxml.h"
```

### 2.3.-Libassert

This library written in C provides a collection of functions that use the assert() macro to check the integrity of their input parameters. By including this library in one project, it can easily incorporate parameter checking into the code without having to write your specific custom error-checking code.

Library can be included in C with:

```c
#include "libassert.h"
```
